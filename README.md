# Kevp75's Compiler for ElementalX on the Essential PH-1

## GO THANK FLAR2 FOR HIS KERNEL!

### The only differences between his and mine are the machines they are compiled on, and I added Uber toolchain

This repo simply contains my bash scripts I use to compile the kernel into flar2's flashable zips, both the aroma one and the non-aroma.

Check the Flashable folders.

- -google.zip is the same toolchain that flar2 uses
- the others are other toolchains that I found that work compiling as well.
- Your usage and mileage may vary, so find the one that works for you and use it.
